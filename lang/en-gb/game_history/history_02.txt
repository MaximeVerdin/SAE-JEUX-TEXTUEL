!Chapter 1: The Spark of Genius
The smell of ozone and the crackling of light bulbs were your only companions in this laboratory where you dreamed of healing the world.
Your first notebook was full of complex diagrams and idealistic promises: you wanted to eradicate pain, one cell at a time.
Prestige is a soft drug; first prizes and applause slowly replaced your sincere desire to help your fellow man.
‘Progress requires sacrifice,’ you repeated to justify the sleepless nights and abandonment of those who loved you.
(Revelation): You were a pioneer in genetic medicine. A man of intellect whose thirst for recognition began to stifle ethics.
!Chapter 2: The Forbidden Protocol
When funds ran out, you accepted investments from a military conspiracy with questionable intentions.
The first animal tests were cruel, but you looked away, thinking of the end result that would ‘save millions of lives’.
Science became a weapon. You began to modify your research to create not cures, but devastating physical enhancements.
The first human subject was a desperate volunteer; you recorded his screams as mere technical notes on your tablet.
(Revelation): You crossed the line by becoming the scientific director of a clandestine super-soldier programme, hidden under a humanitarian façade.
!Chapter 3: The Hand of God
Your creatures did not thank you; they were distorted bodies, reshaped by your serums and inhumane surgical procedures.
You learned to love the power that comes with the right of life or death over a living being in your latex-gloved hands.
Reports of collateral damage in the field were piling up, but you saw only the perfection of your ‘products’ in action.
Your own brother, suffering from an incurable disease, begged you to help him; you saw him as an opportunity to test your most unstable version.
(Revelation): You were no longer a healer. You had become an architect of flesh, a cold deity treating humanity as an error to be corrected.
!Chapter 4: The Final Mutation
Your superiority complex isolated you; you had your colleagues who dared to question the monstrous drift of your work committed to institutions.
Ambition is a poison that paralyses the heart. You no longer saw patients, but single-use experimental material.
One evening, the serum escaped. The creatures you had created began to devour the laboratory staff in unspeakable chaos.
Instead of opening the emergency doors, you activated the total containment protocol to ‘save your data’, condemning everyone inside.
(Revelation): Your brother was the first to mutate. You watched his horrific transformation from behind a safety glass, taking notes until his last breath.
!Chapter 5: The Judgement of Conscience
The data you saved is worthless in this corridor; it is as empty as the empathy you sacrificed.
This hell is a giant laboratory where, for the first time, you are the subject of the experiment, not the experimenter.
Every failure here injects a dose of truth into your veins, a pain that your serums can never heal.
You finally understand: your genius was nothing more than a scalpel used to cut away your own humanity until there was nothing left.
(Final Revelation): Punishment is not physical torture, it is seeing your brother's gaze forever at the moment you chose your data over his life.
