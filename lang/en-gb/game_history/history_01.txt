!Chapter 1: Lost Innocence
Your daughter's laughter was the only music in the house, a bulwark against the silence of the street. We never imagined that silence would eventually prevail.
Those hands, which drew colourful worlds on the walls of her bedroom, would soon learn the texture of cold metal and the weight of secrecy.
Poverty is not a crime, but it is the fuel for rage. When your stomach is empty, morality becomes a luxury you can no longer afford.
Faced with the expulsion notice nailed to the door, you understood: you don't choose to become a wolf for pleasure, but because you refuse to see your own end up as sheep.
(Revelation): You were a loving father. An honest man broken by the world. But in trying to protect your home, you opened the door to darkness.
!Chapter 2: The Downward Spiral
‘Just one job,’ you promised. ‘Just this once, so they won't go without.’ You never know that the first step is the one that leads to the abyss.
The first lie is a light veil thrown over the eyes of those you love. The second is already a shroud that suffocates the truth.
Easy money tastes like sulphur. It burns your pockets, but it buys the silence of creditors and the fleeting smile of a reassured wife.
Those who agree to work in the shadows eventually forget the colour of the sun. Your eyes have grown accustomed to the dark, and so has your heart.
(Revelation): You shook hands with the Devil in a three-piece suit. To save your home, you agreed to become the shadow of this soulless man.
!Chapter 3: Dirty Hands
The first time you pulled the trigger, the world trembled. The tenth time, you didn't even blink. Murder is now just a statistic.
Blood never really washes away. You can wash your hands a thousand times, but the smell of iron remains embedded under your fingernails and in the recesses of your conscience.
Every piece of jewellery you gave your wife, every toy you bought your child, was paid for with the tears and lives of families who were once like you.
On the phone, your daughter asked, ‘Daddy, when are you coming home?’ You replied, ‘Soon,’ your clothes still stained with the pain of another.
(Revelation): You were no longer the protector. You had become the ultimate predator, the one whose name makes people lower their eyes and whose presence freezes the blood.
!Chapter 4: The Point of No Return
Success is built on anonymous graves. You walked over the corpses of your former friends to reach the top of your pyramid of ashes.
Power is a prison with bars made of solid gold. The more powerful you were, the more alone you were, locked in your own paranoia.
In the reflection of the shop windows, you no longer recognised the man you once were. The mirror only reflected the image of the monster you once hunted.
To erase the evidence of betrayal, you gave the order. ‘Burn everything.’ You forgot that fire is a blind judge that does not choose its targets.
(Revelation): The building burned all night. It was only in the morning that you learned your family had been there to surprise you. You destroyed everything.
!Chapter 5: The Final Judgement
Forgiveness is a luxury you burned that night. All that remains is the black smoke of your regrets to block the horizon of your redemption.
There is no escape from this hell, for the corridors are nothing but the twists and turns of your own sick mind. You carry your cell within you.
Every failure in these rooms lengthens your sentence. That is the price you pay for wanting to forget. Clemency here is an insult to your victims.
You finally understand: prison is not this place made of stone and shadows. Prison is the man you have become and from whom you can no longer escape.
(Final Revelation): Punishment is not death, it is eternity spent remembering your daughter's hand, which you let go of for a handful of gold.
