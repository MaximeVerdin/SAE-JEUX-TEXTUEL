!Chapter 1: The Flame of Justice
Your first cases were driven by an invincible faith in the truth. You sincerely believed that the law could heal the ills of the world.
The smell of old paper and the ink of penal codes were your sanctuary. For you, every conviction was a victory for good over evil.
They called you "The Just". But behind this nickname, a dangerous certainty grew: the idea that you could never be wrong.
You began to despise nuance. For you, the world was now divided into two camps: the perfect and the guilty.
(Revelation): You were a renowned prosecutor. A man whose exemplary rigour slowly slipped into an obsession with total control.
!Chapter 2: The Unbalanced Scales
To secure a difficult conviction, you concealed a minor piece of evidence. "A small omission for a greater good", you told yourself.
The end began to justify the means. You hired crooked informants to fabricate the evidence missing from your cases.
The court became your arena. You no longer sought the truth, but the submission of your opponents under the weight of your indictments.
You sent an innocent man to prison to protect the reputation of your office. The look on his face at the verdict did not make you blink.
(Revelation): You made a pact with the corruption you claimed to be fighting, using the secrets of the powerful to establish your own authority.
!Chapter 3: The Hammer of Terror
You created a special unit, a shadow militia charged with eliminating those whom the law could not reach. Justice became an execution.
The gaols you supervised were filled with broken voices. For you, they were no longer men, but closed files.
Your own best friend, an honest judge, tried to expose you. You used your networks to frame him for treason.
Paranoia replaced reason. You saw conspiracies everywhere, justifying each new arrest with an illusory sense of security.
(Revelation): You were no longer a servant of the state. You had become a modern-day dictator, a tyrant who used the penal code as a weapon of war
!Chapter 4: The Blood Verdict
The pinnacle of power was a tower of silence. You were surrounded by courtiers who feared your pen more than your sword.
You signed execution orders by the thousands, your heart as dry as the parchment on which you affixed your seal.
An uprising broke out against your regime of terror. Instead of dialogue, you ordered a repression of unprecedented violence.
In the chaos of the revolt, you condemned your own son, who had joined the insurgents to clear your name.
(Revelation): You watched his execution from your balcony, convinced to the last moment that the law was more important than blood.
!Chapter 5: The Internal Tribunal
The corridors of this hell are paved with the codes of law that you flouted. Every stone is testimony to your treason.
Here, you are no longer the prosecutor. You are the sole defendant in a trial that will never end.
Each failure in these trials is further evidence added to your record of eternal condemnation.
You finally understand: the justice you demanded for others is the justice that crushes you today. There can be no further appeal.
(Final Revelation) : The punishment is not the pain of the wards, it is the image of your son falling into the dust because of your own signature.
