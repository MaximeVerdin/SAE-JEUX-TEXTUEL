You wake up in the cold of an endless labyrinth, where your memories are nothing but dust and your body is the only proof of your sins.

To guide your steps in the darkness of these corridors, use the Z, Q, S and D keys to move up, left, down or right.

Every corner may hold a remnant of your past or a fragment of your history.

Stay vigilant and use the F key to interact with objects, search chests or cross obstacles that block your path.

Be aware that your sins will take physical form before you, and they will not let you pass without paying a price in suffering.

To survive, you will have to learn how to fight.

In combat, you will have a choice between two actions:
Press 1 to ATTACK your tormentors,
or press 2 to BLOCK their attacks and endure your pain.

Never forget that what you refuse to face today will continue to haunt your mind until the end of your sentence.

Good luck.
